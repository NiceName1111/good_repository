Hello, I would like to introduce myself as Niceway on GitHub. This is my nickname in my high school. I am a International Finance and Economic Policy student. Currently, I am learning to program with Python. I hope new skill will increase my working efficiency in the future. Also, I wish to hand some repetitive work to automation programs so that I can spend more time in creative work.
It is nice to start the journey of coding. ^_^
